# Wall Street Bets

## Scenario

You have been recruited to a hedge fund. They are concerned that there are new market risks that are currently unforeseen to their investment managers. For example, the rise of the retail investor through applications like RobinHood have invited millions of amateur investors to the market. The additional rise of amateur, unsophisticated investors was not thought of as a risk until many of these investors organized on a Reddit Forum called WallStreetBets. On this forum information and investment ideas are shared.

In early 2021, the forum investors caused a sudden rise in Gamestop&#39;s stock. Many investors there pushed into gamestop causing many brokerages to halt or limit trading. This sudden rise cost professional investors, particularly &quot;short sellers&quot; to lose billions.

The sudden rise from $20 to $350 within a month.

**As a result, you have been asked to examine the text and look for any early indication that gamestop was gaining traction and that it was poised to move. This &quot;signal&quot; could help the hedge fund monitor this and other public forums to avoid future losses like this.**
